# Frontend building

JavaScript and CSS is bundled using Webpack.
To build CSS and JavaScript, NPM needs to be installed first,
then you can run the following commands. They need to be run inside this directory.

* `npm install`
* `npm run build` builds the CSS and JavaScript and puts the bundle inside `dist/`
* `npm run watch` rebuilds the bundle whenever source files have changed
